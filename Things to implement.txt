1: Proper OnState-messages. This means that the order when transitioning from state A to state B is guaranteed to be:

- A.StateUpdate
- A.StateExit
- B.StateEnter
- B.StateUpdate

This also means that StateMachineEnter and StateMachineExit will be called whenever a state machine is entered/exited, not
just when the flow goes through the entry/exit nodes.

2: Awake and OnEnable for the states. This will be the same as for the AnimatorFix script

3: A bigger and better API for getting information about the current state of the Animator. This will include:
- CurrentStateName
- CurrentStateMachine/s
- IsInState/Machine that looks a lot better than the default ones
- IsTransitioningTo/From + GetCurrentTransition

All of these will default to layer 0. This means that this attrocity:
    if(animator.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0).IsName("Foo"))

Is turned into:
    if(animator.IsInState("Foo"))

Which just reads so_much_better

4: Performance: Once all the other stuff is done, this has to be measured and fixed. Both for GC and for general speed.
